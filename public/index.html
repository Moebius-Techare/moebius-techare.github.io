<h1 id="möbius">Möbius</h1>
<p>Moebius is the section association for the mathematics section (MAT) within <a href="https://utn.se/en">UTN</a>.
Möbius is the section association that focuses on students of mathematics. However, everyone is welcome to join! We have a room in <a href="https://link.mazemap.com/ITtb4vV4">house 18</a> (the middle house of the red houses outside Ångström).</p>
<p>Here you can find likeminded or differentminded folk, who enjoys playing games, watching TV-shows in the couch, eating microwave food and helping you with studying&hellip; so that they can procrastinate their own studying.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-section-association">What is a section association?</h2>
<p>The Uppsala Union of Science and Technology (UTN) divides all students into one of 20 different boxes, called sections. There are sections for subject teachers, technical physics and mathematics among several others. The mathematics section is called MAT. All sections have an associated section association that represents the students in the section. Möbius is the mathematicians&rsquo; section association. A section association&rsquo;s task is to, among other things, monitor studies for the students.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-student-monitoring">What is student monitoring?</h2>
<p>Student monitoring is about exerting influence to improve students&rsquo; working conditions. According to the Higher Education Act, we have the right to be represented when decisions are made. For Möbius, this means that we elect representatives to, among other things, the Bachelor&rsquo;s Program Council, the Master&rsquo;s Program Council and the Department Board.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-moebius-student-monitoring-look-like">What does Moebius student monitoring look like?</h2>
<p>Twice a semester, Moebius organizes member meetings/study council meetings for bachelor students and master lunches for master students. There you get the opportunity to evaluate courses and choose which issues we should pursue. If you think that a course is missing or that a certain type of examination should be used more often, you can bring it up at our members&rsquo; meetings and we will push the issue further.
At these meetings, you also get information about what is happening at the university and the union. In order for us to be able to monitor studies, it is important that we are given issues to pursue. If we don&rsquo;t say what can be improved, it&rsquo;s difficult for the university to do anything about it. In addition to our meetings, which are the basic activities, we also organize coffee breaks and study clubs.</p>
<p>If you have trouble with your courses you are more than welcome to contact us, we are here to help!</p>
<h2 id="channels-of-information">Channels of information</h2>
<p>If you want information about what is happening in and around Moebius then it is best to sign up in the Möbius email-list. There is also a Facebook page and an Instagram page. For tickets to events we use Orbi.</p>
