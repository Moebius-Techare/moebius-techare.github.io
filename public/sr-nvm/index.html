Together with Möbius the Study council NVM make up the mathematics secion (NVM) within UTN (the union).
What is a section and a section association?
UTN divides all students into boxes, about 20 so called sections based on what program you study. The section for the bachelor and master programmes in mathematics is called NVM (NaturVetare Matematiker = Scientists Mathematicians). Every section has a section association that represents the students in that section. For NVM Möbius is the section association." />

  <h1 id="study-council">Study council</h1>
<p>Together with Möbius the Study council NVM make up the mathematics secion (NVM) within UTN (the union).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-section-and-a-section-association">What is a section and a section association?</h2>
<p>UTN divides all students into boxes, about 20 so called sections based on what program you study. The section for the bachelor and master programmes in mathematics is called NVM (NaturVetare Matematiker = Scientists Mathematicians). Every section has a section association that represents the students in that section. For NVM Möbius is the section association.</p>
<h2 id="where-does-the-study-council-come-into-the-picture">Where does the study council come into the picture?</h2>
<p>Möbius have outsourced the study monitoring part to the association Studie Council NVM.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-study-monitoring">What is study monitoring?</h2>
<p>In Sweden we have a very unique relationship between universities and students. According to law students have a right to be represented everywhere decisions are made in the university. Study monitoring is about improving the working conditions of students. For the study council it means that we choose representatives for the Bachelor programme council, master programme council and the mathematical institutions board.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-study-council-do">What does the study council do?</h2>
<p>The study council arranges study council meetings twice per semester for bachelor level students and two master lunches for master students. There you have the opportunity to evaluate your courses and tell us what questions that you think are important.<br>
At these meetings you also get information about what is happening at the university and at the union.</p>
<h2 id="join-the-union">Join the union!</h2>
<p>Together we are strong and with more members in the union we have more power to act for the betterment of the students at the TekNat faculty. It is also free to join the union and for each member the study council gets more money to spend on the meetings and lunches! <a href="https://unicorestudent.com/utn/en/shop">Join the union today!</a></p>
<h2 id="representatives-that-the-council-appoint">Representatives that the council appoint</h2>
<p>The Studycouncil NVM appoints the following representatives.</p>
