# Möbius SOL

Moebius SOL is a board game association in the same building as Möbius. We have many bookcases filled with board games in one of the common rooms. Everything from Catan to Twister to Terraforming Mars. Moebius SOL arranges semi-regular gaming night where everyone are welcome to show up and play games. Information about these events will be posted on our email-list which you can find below. We also arrange boardgame buying meetings once a year where we decide what games to buy.
